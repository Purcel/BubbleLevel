## DoTimer: Privacy policy

This is an open source Android app developed by Iulian Purcell. The source code is available on
GitHub under the Mozilla Public License 2.0; the app is also available on Google Play.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps
collect your data without your knowledge.

I hereby state, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable
information.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any
question regarding how the app protects your privacy, please send me an email or post a discussion
on GitHub, and I will surely try to fix it/help you.
